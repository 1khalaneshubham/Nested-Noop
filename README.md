# Nested-Noop
A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. Although all kinds of loops can be nested, the most common nested loop involves for loops. These loops are particularly useful when displaying multidimensional data. When using these loops, the first iteration of the first loop will initialize, followed by the second loop.
